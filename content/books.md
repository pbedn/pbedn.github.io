Not every book I read exist in English, so here are selected micro reviews.

### James S.A. Corey - The Expanse series (finished in February 2022)

* Science Fiction
* an epic space opera

A journey that finished too soon. Overall very good, and I hope they will continue with the cycle as TV show (for now they cut story in half). Though I still think Battlestar Galactica series was better, the Expanse is second contender for my favourite s-f opera. Binge read/watch worthy.

### James S.A. Corey - Leviathan Wakes (September 2021)

* Science Fiction 

The time has come, after years, finally got me into this book (audiobook like everything recently). I knew it will be good, and it was. Mechanical science fiction, without too much magic and set in a universe I could believe might really happen. For a book to get to the masses, authors need to provide a kind of soap (space) opera style, with a variety of heroes and villains, preferably all in a grey zone, or use a criminal/thriller template. When one of these two is put in the s-f universe, we get a story that will receive Hugo awards. Btw. another good detective/s-f is 'Altered Carbon'. The Expanse series just started for me, but I am so excited. And I am happy to start now when the last-tenth book will premiere soon, so I do not have to wait years for the series to finish (wink GGRM).
Highly recommend - 5 asteroid rocks out of five.

#### Jordan Hudgens - Skill Up: A Software Developer's Guide to Life and Career: 65 steps to becoming a better developer (June 2021)

* Programming soft skills 

Small chapters, like taken from blog posts, dealing with the various topic: Coder skills (learning and working techniques), Freelancer skills (software engineering soft skills), Career skills (passion, career, interviews). This is good for somebody at the beginning of a developer career. 
I will not take much except few pages about interview questions.
Level: 0-1/10 


#### Ryan Holiday - Ego Is the Enemy (June 2021)

* Philosophy
* how to be a better leader

Going with the flow, I took the next Ryan book, this read was quicker, as more stories and less philosophy was packed, where you need to stop and think.
More Americanism, less ancient. For a simple programmer, not yet CEO, this book is good, though not deserve my shelf yet. Or I am not ready...


#### Ryan Holiday - The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph (June 2021)

* Philosophy
* ancient stoic teachers with double power

A second look at ancient philosophy, less general than previous with a focus on the obstacle. This is a very good read.
And after listening first time an audiobook, I bought a paper copy because this is something worth rereading and having on the shelf.
Read, learn, do and repeat.

#### Matthew Van Natta - "The Beginner's Guide to Stoicism: Tools for Emotional Resilience and Positivity" (May 2021)

* Philosophy
* a lot of small pieces of advice from ancient stoic teachers packed in brief

This was my first look into stoicism and I would say, the topic is worth researching. But I guess less wisdom at the beginning is better as one can easily get lost and overwhelmed. And this little book was that and needs rereading or looking somewhere else.
Rating: three stoic beards out of five.

#### Tim Tamashiro - "How to Ikigai: Lessons for Finding Happiness and Living Your Life's Purpose" (April 2021)

* Self Help, Philosophy
* Tim personal story and few other people in the context of Ikigai

Ikigai is life's purpose. In general, one should do:
1) what you love
2) what the world needs
3) what you are paid for
4) what you are great at

#### Héctor García, Francesc Miralles - "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life" (April 2021)

* Self Help, Health, Philosophy
* short story about Okinawa elders and few general tips on wellbeing

I like the concept of Ikigai, but in this book, though "it started it all", Ikigai is barely mentioned. Most focus is put on general tips. I read already other books about self-help, so nothing new. One thing to remember, if you like to live long then grow vegetables in your garden. 100 years of living guaranteed.

#### Naval - “Surviving Belize”, “You Snooze, You Lose”, “The Gulf” and “Camp Pozzi” (March 2021)

* biography
* a story of GROM soldier from recruitment, boot camp, training, military actions, deployments to Iraq

I read, actually listened to, four books by Naval about his military adventures. And as for someone who was dreaming when young, about being a 'commando', these stories were interesting and inspiring. Books are short but immersive. Real action from a real soldier. And as a funny note, Naval was consulting on the "Medal of Honor. Warfighter" game, which was very good as well (solid linear military fps).

#### Kafir - “Contact. Polish intelligence forces in Afghanistan” (March 2021)

* biography
* polish intelligence officer serving 1 year in Afghanistan during "stabilization mission"

Honest and sometimes brutal truth about so-called stabilization mission, and war in reality. The author shows the life inside the military base and interactions with local people. During his deployment, he was involved in a few dangerous, life-threatening missions. In between that stories he does a good job analysing the geopolitical situation and criticise the way things are done. Interesting note - people in Afghanistan have another way of thinking (in terms of tribal, family and social laws they are still hundreds of years in the past), so trying to force them modern democracy is just not working as expected.

#### Ernest Cline - "Ready Player One" (February 2021)

* science fiction
* young cyber padawan on a road to get princess and half of the kingdom (actually quarter)

Beginning a little boring, middle ok, ending better. Sometimes annoying and trivial, and how the heck the main hero just knows everything and plays the guitar like a god.
In general, I enjoyed it, but I am not going to read the second part - Ready Player Two and the author's other book - Armada too much of the 80s in the first part for me ;)
As for the rating, I am giving three eggs out of five.
