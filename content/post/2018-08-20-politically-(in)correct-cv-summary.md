As software developers, we have a very comfortable life because usually, the recruiters are calling to us, and not otherwise.
Not always the talks are intelligent and sometimes are just a waste of time. Usually, it is not the fault of recruiters, because it is easy to get lost in the myriads of technology buzzwords and misinterpret them. Occasionally they are just not experienced enough to distinguish junior from a senior candidate.

Sometimes, however, the developers need to put more work in having a well presented professional side of our personality, and worse, update it often. Apparently, this is not our strongest side, an excellent solution would be to put ourselves in the hands of the professional agency. Some still will choose the harder way, well...

In the process of writing an excellent summary, that actually somebody will read, we have to be a CEO of a well-established company or follow hundreds of tips and be aware to not repeat by accident mistakes of other 99% of people, like using 
[yearly-updated-list-of-common-buzzwords](https://blog.linkedin.com/2018/january/25/find-the-right-words-to-land-the-right-job).
Unfortunately, we cannot be a skilled expert, who is passionate, creative and motivated.
Worse if somebody is focused at work, and have strategic thinking ability. Specialized developers or those with leadership skill are guilty of being visible in the professional community.

> *Nobody will read your resume anyway*


Going along this path, I am proposing an ideal candidate summary:

Incompetent, amateur full stack web developer with indifference for technology and beating the metrics. Have broad and general knowledge about everything. Fruitless and unproductive at current company. Discouraged and disorganised the whole team of 30 engineers. Could not plan even trivial projects, felt bored all the time. Powerless with people. 

;)

In the end, I want to add my personal proposal of well-thought summary, something I would like to tell my recruiter.


I am a software engineer, not a fkn copywriter. I write code, not fantastic CVs. 
I like to feel my brain is burning when solving a challenging task, that is the moment I am in the flow. Otherwise, I am bored as hell.
I like to be in competition, although I hate the rat race. 
I prefer strategic thinking over quick MPV - Maybe our Product is Valid.
I am the Engineer - I learnt how to find things when I need and do not remember it all. I solve problems. I fix errors. I produce results.
