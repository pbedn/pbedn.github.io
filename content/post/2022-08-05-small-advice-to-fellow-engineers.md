I was working as an outsourced engineer for Big Corporation, or I could say I was in the "shadow workforce". And as the initial challenge dust disappeared, I was flying on remaining knowledge, but up to a point. There is a moment when you need to cut yourself out of your comfort zone. And I know that it is really difficult for people, especially after crossing the magic "three-year" point. 

Is there a field for personal development? Great, use that opportunity, to learn a new language or some technology. Maybe there are less experienced engineers you could mentor. Help them, in the end, it is all about people. Of course, there is always some documentation to be improved. If you will be recognised for your current and past achievements, great, that might push you forward. If not, then stop and rethink, maybe it is time to leave. And do not overthink.

Life is short, and the world of software development is vast.
