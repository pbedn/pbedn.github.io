This year, I attended the EuroPython conference in Prague for three days. Let me share some thoughts afterwards.

<!--more-->

### Conference
Plan of the conference:
* Two Workshop/Tutorial Days (8-9 July, Mon-Tue)
* Three Conference Days (10-12 July, Wed-Fri)
* Sprint Weekend (13-14 July, Sat-Sun)

I had a "Personal - Conference" ticket, which means I paid for the conference myself (€300), and was only on three days on 10-12 July (no pre tutorials, and sprint weekend).
And this was my first bad choice, next time if I would go again, then only for a full week. 

Although the tutorials are mostly for beginners, the whole conference is not about learning something new but meeting people. Same about the sprints, I have already preplanned my trip (hotels, travels etc.), but the better idea would be to take one more day off from work, and extend my stay in Prague to attend them. 
And again, not to make some change to the world, but rather to see how others are trying to do it. Especially since there was a sprint organized by CPython core developers, probably the only and most interesting one of all sprints.

### Networking
I have come "prepared" for the conference by having read some articles beforehand, how one should behave, and how to take the most out of it.

I have not been sitting only at talks but tried "other activities" instead. Go around the corridor and meet new people, talk to sponsors and companies, see what is in open spaces, and be at evening social parties. 

And I think I have not been lucky, because I am not back with "tons" of new contacts in my Linkedin. I think that partly is because the main three-day conference is rather big, with over 1200 attendees. Mostly groups sent by companies that stick to each other, though they are open to socialising, it is not about looking for new people.

In terms of job opportunities, none. As there were mostly product companies trying to promote themselves.

### Talks
Some talks were just ok, some better. Some long keynotes were really bad, and the best prelections that should be keynotes have been put into a 20-minute slot.

#### Best
[Pablo Galindo Salgado - Tales from the abyss: some of the most obscure CPython bugs](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/tales-from-the-abyss-some-of-the-most-obscure-cpython-bugs)

Room full. Funny but informative. With nerdy jokes but explaining even more nerdier stuff. The meat of the conference, from programmer to programmer.

#### Good
[Miriam Forner: Why communication is the best skill you can develop as a programmer](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/why-communication-is-the-best-skill-you-can-develop-as-a-programmer)

Rom was full, looks like it is an important topic for developers. Some quotes:
* Write code so your past you would understand it
* Do not rely on comments to convey meaning
* Explain the problem without assuming prior knowledge

--

[Štěpán Šindelář: GraalPy - Fast Python Implementation](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/graalpy-fast-python-implementation)

Not many people in the room. About how one can use Python in the Java world. Modern replacement for Jython.

--

[Anna-Lena Popkes: When and how to start coding with kids](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/when-and-how-to-start-coding-with-kids)

Remote speaker, but a well-prepared presentation, though it felt strange watching from the projector. Pretty informative.
* Parents should start by giving simple instructions, use space repetitive learning.
* Divide teaching into sections because kids are easily distracted. 
* Do not push the knowledge but make it fun. 
* Use ScratchJr, Scratch etc.

#### Worst
[Abhinand C: Building Event-Driven Python service using FastStream and AsyncAPI](https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/building-event-driven-python-service-using-faststream-and-asyncapi)

Remote speaker, probably sick, terrible accent and intonation. Unreadable slides, unreadable. Most of the people left the room after the first few minutes. Because this was the last talk on Friday before the last keynote I stayed but well..

### Other
I did not like that I was so pushed into all DEI stuff. From all-gender toilets (that no one wanted to use anyway) to keynotes saying male managers are bad and female managers are good.

Second, the Thursday evening social event was paid extra and not included in the ticket. People had to buy it through the website, and then pick up tickets from registration at some specific time. The social event should be free for all and the entrance mechanism by only show your conference QR code.

### Summary
Is it worth attending next time? Maybe only as a speaker (as a form of self-marketing) or a volunteer. 

Would I recommend going as a lone wolf? Only if never been to such an event, and for a full week, as this is the best way to meet more people. 

The ideal way to go to the conference if it's during work hours and company-sponsored (and use limited holidays for family time).
