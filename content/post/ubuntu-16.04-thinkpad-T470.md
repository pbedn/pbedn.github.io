One month of fighting with Mate I returned to "classic Ubuntu" with Unity desktop. And it just works. That's it.

The beginning was very cool. Drinking my Yerba Mate and using Ubuntu Mate. But after a recent update, something happened, and laptop started to freeze during boot. I did not found any good solutions on the web except reinstalling my windows or nvidia drivers... (I have neither of them)   
I tried changing grub and bios options but did not help. So I have installed a stock system from ubuntu.com.

Pro:

* Everything works out of the box.

Con:

* It takes much more resources, so I will be gradually looking for some solutions to optimize. But I have at least good starting point.
