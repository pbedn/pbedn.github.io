Once upon a not-so-distant time, before instant answers and endless abstractions, 
there lived developers, who survived on documentation, patience, and the courage to think before they typed.

Here we gather to remember the ancient creatures known as developers,
who once roamed the vast lands of documentation and spent entire days staring at walls,
ceiling corners, or compiler errors, thinking—really thinking—about solutions before typing a single line of code;

they read manuals thicker than modern laptops, evolved slowly through trial, error, and coffee, and believed that understanding was a requirement, not a luxury,
until one day they quietly went extinct, fossilized beneath layers of abstractions, frameworks, and autogenerated answers,
remembered by no one except a few gray-bearded elders who still whisper about pointers, algorithms, and the joy of finally solving a problem at 2 a.m.;

so let us, once in a while, raise a glass in their honor and promise—satirically, respectfully,
and with a small smile—not to forget that code was once written by minds, not merely produced by machines.
